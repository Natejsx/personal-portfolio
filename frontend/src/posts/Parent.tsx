        I want to start this post by saying that I don't have kids. I have two
        beautiful cats, my baby girls, who I would die for without hesitation.
        I'm not kidding.
        <br />
        <br />
        That said, I've been wanting to write about parenting for a long time.
        Not because I think I have all the answers, but because it's a topic
        that's fascinated me even at a young age. Parenting shapes people. It
        defines relationships, self-worth, confidence, and sometimes even the
        way someone sees the world. And yet, despite how impactful it is,
        everyone seems to have a different definition of what good parenting
        actually looks like.
        <br />
        <br />
        Not everyone wants kids, and that's completely valid. But for those who
        do want to be parents, or already are, I think there's a question worth
        asking:
        <br />
        <br />
        <em>What does being a good parent actually mean in your eyes?</em>
        <br />
        <br />
        I ask this because every family I've interacted with seems to have its
        own version of the “right” way to raise a child. Some value discipline
        above all else. Others prioritize emotional support. Some focus on
        structure, tradition, or faith. Others emphasize freedom, individuality,
        and self-expression. None of these are inherently wrong, but they can
        come into conflict when a child grows into someone their parents didn't
        expect.
        <br />
        <br />
        Let me give you an example.
        <br />
        <br />I have a friend, out of respect for him and his family, I'll call
        him Justin. Justin is a good guy in my personal opinion. Thoughtful,
        respectful, and introspective. He grew up in a religious household, but
        as he got older, he realized that he didn't personally align with the
        faith he was raised in. He doesn't mock it. He doesn't attack it. He
        doesn't try to provoke or distance himself intentionally. He quite
        simply just doesn't practice it.
        <br />
        <br />
        That alone has caused a strain in his relationship with his parents.
        <br />
        <br />
        Justin wants a good relationship with them. He yearns for connection,
        understanding, and acceptance. But his parents struggle to separate
        their beliefs from their expectations of him. To them, faith isn't just
        personal, it's foundational. And because Justin doesn't share it, they
        see his choice not as individuality, but as rejection almost.
        <br />
        <br />
        So here's the question:
        <br />
        <br />
        <em>
          Are Justin's parents right for standing firm in their faith, even if
          it costs them closeness with their son? Or are they wrong for
          prioritizing belief over the emotional needs of their child?
        </em>
        <br />
        <br />
        There's no easy answer here, but I know where I stand.
        <br />
        <br />
        I strongly believe that loving your child should be unconditional. Not
        conditional on belief. Not conditional on career choice. Not conditional
        on how closely they resemble the version of a life you imagined for
        them.
        <br />
        <br />
        Your child might grow up and choose a different path than the one you
        hoped for. They might not pursue the career you dreamed of. They might
        not play the sport you invested years into. They might not share your
        religion, politics, or even worldview.
        <br />
        <br />
        And the real question is:{" "}
        <em>
          would you still love them the same? Or would resentment quietly take
          root?
        </em>
        <br />
        <br />
        I think that's the part of parenting we don't talk about enough. Loving
        the idea of a child is easy. Loving the reality of who they become,
        especially when it challenges your values, is much harder.
        <br />
        <br />
        Children aren't extensions of their parents. They're not projects.
        They're not reflections meant to validate your choices or beliefs.
        They're individuals who will eventually think for themselves, disagree
        with you, and define their own identity.
        <br />
        <br />
        To me, good parenting isn't about control. It's about guidance without
        possession. It's about teaching values while allowing room for
        deviation. It's about creating a safe place where your child feels loved
        even when they disappoint you, or simply become someone you didn't
        expect.
        <br />
        <br />
        I don't have children. But I do have empathy. And I've seen what happens
        when love feels conditional. It doesn't motivate growth, it breeds
        distance, fear, and silence.
        <br />
        <br />
        There's a difference between loving a child and loving the version of
        them that makes you comfortable. That sentence alone is uncomfortable
        for many people, especially parents. But discomfort doesn't mean it
        isn't true. In fact, it's often the clearest indicator that something
        important is being touched.
        <br />
        <br />
        Many parents "<em>believe</em>" their love is unconditional, until it's
        tested. Until their child disagrees. Until they deviate from the plan.
        Until they disappoint, challenge, or simply grow into someone
        unexpected. That's usually when conditions quietly appear. Sometimes
        they're spoken out loud. Other times they're subtle, implied, or
        enforced through silence, distance, or even disappointment.
        <br />
        <br />
        Approval becomes tied to obedience. Affection becomes tied to belief.
        Pride becomes tied to achievement. Over time, the child learns something
        deeply formative: love isn't guaranteed, it's earned.
        <br />
        <br />
        That kind of love doesn't guide. It controls.
        <br />
        <br />
        When love becomes conditional, a child stops asking, “<em>Who am I?</em>
        ” and starts asking, “<em>Who do I need to be to stay loved?</em>” That
        shift is small, but its consequences last for decades. It teaches
        children to hide parts of themselves, to perform instead of exist, and
        to associate honesty with risk.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unconditional love doesn't mean permissiveness. It doesn't mean a lack
        of values, boundaries, or accountability. It doesn't mean agreement.
        What it means is separating who your child is from what your child
        chooses.
        <br />
        <br />
        It means being able to say: “
        <em>I don't agree with you, but I still see you.</em>” “
        <em>I don't understand your choices, but I still love you.</em>” and “
        <em>
          You didn't turn out the way I imagined, but I still want you in my
          life.
        </em>
        ”
        <br />
        <br />
        That distinction matters more than most people realize.
        <br />
        <br />
        I think many parents struggle not because their child is “wrong,” but
        because their child doesn't match the future they imagined.
        <br />
        <br />
        Before a child is even born, a narrative is created. Parents imagine who
        their child will be, what they'll believe, how they'll live, what
        success will look like for them. These expectations are often
        well-intentioned. They're shaped by love, hope, culture, fear, and
        personal experience.
        <br />
        <br />
        But children don't grow into narratives. They grow into themselves.
        <br />
        <br />
        When identity collides with expectation, something has to give. Either
        the parent loosens their grip on the imagined future, or the child
        learns to suppress their reality. Too often, it's the child who bends.
        <br />
        <br />
        Healthy parenting, in my eyes, requires a kind of quiet grief, the
        willingness to let go of the version of your child you dreamed up so you
        can fully love the person standing in front of you.
        <br />
        <br />
        That's not easy. It asks parents to confront disappointment, to question
        their own assumptions, and to accept that love doesn't guarantee
        similarity. But it's necessary.
        <br />
        <br />
        Because the alternative is loving a ghost, an idea, while neglecting the
        living, breathing human being right in front of you.
        <br />
        <br />
        The consequences of conditional parenting don't always show up
        immediately.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sometimes they don't appear until years later, when the child is an
        adult. When conversations become shallow. When visits feel obligatory
        instead of warm. When honesty is rationed. When certain topics are
        avoided, not out of respect, but out of self-preservation.
        <br />
        <br />
        You see it in adults who struggle with self-worth because approval
        always felt temporary. In people who second-guess every decision because
        autonomy once came with consequences. In strained relationships where
        love exists, but trust does not.
        <br />
        <br />
        Parents may believe they're “standing their ground,” protecting values,
        or maintaining authority. But often what they're really teaching is that
        love comes with conditions, and that honesty has a cost.
        <br />
        <br />
        That lesson doesn't disappear with age. It just gets internalized. I
        don't just believe this in theory. I've watched it play out in my own
        family.
        <br />
        <br />
        My family is far from perfect. I've seen my uncles and aunts argue over
        lifestyle choices, and I've witnessed firsthand how those conflicts
        spill over onto their kids. When a household becomes divided, children
        feel it immediately. They develop unhealthy coping habits, spend more
        time away from home, and distract themselves to escape the tension
        they're living in. The damage isn't always loud, but it's lasting.
        <br />
        <br />
        What bothered me most wasn't just the arguing. It was how difficult it
        seemed for people to accept that others will choose lives different from
        their own. Why is that so hard? Why does disagreement so often turn into
        judgment instead of understanding?
        <br />
        <br />
        I've lost close relationships with cousins because of this. There are
        texts I've sent that I'm still quietly hoping will get a response, even
        though I know deep down they probably won't. That distance didn't come
        from one dramatic fallout, it formed slowly, when love began to feel
        conditional and connection stopped feeling safe.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm not perfect. My lifestyle won't be everyone's cup of tea, and it
        doesn't need to be. I'm not here to meet every expectation or live in a
        way that pleases everyone around me. I'm here to live a simple, honest,
        and rewarding life. And if my personal choices don't harm you in any
        real way, why judge them? Why let a disagreement determine how much love
        you're willing to give?
        <br />
        <br />I once heard a quote that stuck with me: “
        <em>Be kind to your parents, it's their first time on Earth too.</em>” I
        believe there's truth in that. None of us are born knowing how to do
        this perfectly. We're all learning as we go.
        <br />
        <br />
        But understanding that shouldn't excuse hurting your children simply
        because you don't see eye to eye. Growth and grace have to go both ways.
        Being human doesn't give us permission to wound the people we're
        supposed to protect.
        <br />
        <br />
        To be fair, I don't think most parents act this way out of cruelty. I
        think they act out of fear. Fear that their child will suffer. Fear that
        they failed to raise them. Fear that letting go means losing control or
        Fear that deviation means danger.
        <br />
        <br />
        This fear is especially powerful when belief systems like religious,
        cultural, or morals are deeply tied to identity. When a child steps away
        from those systems, it can feel like rejection, not just of beliefs, but
        of the parent themselves.
        <br />
        <br />
        But fear, when it leads to parenting, creates distance. Love should be
        the anchor, not fear. Fear narrows vision. Love widens it. Fear asks,
        “<em>How do I stop this?</em>” Love asks, “<em>How do I stay connected?</em>”
        <br />
        <br />
        Parents don't need to abandon their values to love unconditionally. They
        need to decide what matters more: being right, or being present. If
        you're a parent right now, or hope to be one day, I think this is worth
        asking yourself honestly:
        <br />
        <br />
        “<em>If your child grows into someone different than you imagined, how will
        you meet them? With curiosity or resistance? With openness or
        disappointment? With love, or with conditions?</em>”
        <br />
        <br />
        Because long after careers, beliefs, achievements, and expectations
        fade, the relationship is what remains. And the child will remember, not
        what you demanded of them, but whether they felt safe being themselves
        in your presence.
        <br />
        <br />
        That, more than anything else, is what love looks like when it's truly
        unconditional in my opinion.
        <br />
        <br />
        If I ever become a parent, I hope I remember that my job wouldn't be to
        mold my child into who I want them to be. It would be to support who
        they are becoming.
