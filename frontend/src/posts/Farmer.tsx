                Since I was young, I knew I wanted to be a software engineer.
                <br />
                <br />
                Code felt like magic. You could type symbols into a machine and shape reality. You could build tools, platforms, even entire ecosystems. You could create something that thousands of people interact with daily, something invisible, yet everywhere.
                <br />
                <br />
                To a kid watching technology reshape the world, that was intoxicating. And that dream never left. I still love building. I love systems. I love architecture. I love taking a blank repository and turning it into something alive. My projects, the long hours, and this blog itself that I'm writing this one, they all stand as evidence that ambition still burns inside me.
                <br />
                <br />
                But as I've grown older, something else has grown too. A quiet counterweight. The desire to walk away from all of it. I wouldn't walk away in failure, or frustration. But in clarity.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you were to ask me as a teenager, deep in tutorials and obsessing over frameworks, convinced I was going to build something world-changing, whether I'd ever want to live anywhere but a city, I would've laughed at you. I would've laughed hard actually.
                <br />
                <br />
                The city felt like oxygen. It felt like opportunities, felt like proximity to ambition. Skyscrapers meant startups. Coffee shops meant laptops. Noise meant movement. Movement meant progress. To not want that, to not want to be a software engineer, to not want to be surrounded by other people chasing something, would have sounded like surrender. Like giving up before the race even started.
                <br />
                <br />
                Back then, the idea of living on a farm felt absurd. Slow. Isolated. Detached from relevance. But something shifted in me as I got older.
                <br />
                <br />
                Now there are moments when I imagine doing something drastic. Leaving without announcement. Not from anger or resentment. Just quietly disappearing. Buying a flip phone. Letting social media and the world dissolve into the background. Trading infinite scroll for finite land. Waking up to birds instead of engines. Wind instead of sirens. Sunlight instead of a glowing screen.
                <br />
                <br />
                There's something so beautiful about that kind of isolation. Not loneliness, but  a simple separation.
                <br />
                <br />
                Separation from the constant comparison. From the subtle pressure to be visible, to be productive, to be updating something. Separation from the noise that makes it hard to tell which desires are actually yours and which ones were handed to you.
                <br />
                <br />
                The thought of stepping outside first thing in the morning and hearing nothing but nature, no cars blaring down the boulevard, no distant construction, no notification vibrations, feels almost rebellious. Like reclaiming something ancient.
                <br />
                <br />
                I think when I was younger, I equated isolation with failure. I thought relevance required proximity. That if you weren't in the center of things, you were falling behind.
                <br />
                <br />
                Now I'm starting to wonder if sometimes stepping away is the only way to hear yourself clearly. And that kind of quiet? It doesn't scare me anymore.
                <br />
                <br />
                It draws me.
                <br />
                <br />
                There are days when I imagine selling everything, moving across the country, buying a small piece of land, and living in a quiet house far from the nearest neighbor. No timelines. No launch schedules. No Homework. And definitely no performance metrics.
                <br />
                <br />
                Just land, seasons and honest work that begins when the sun rises and ends when it sets. And the strange part is that the more ambitious I become, the stronger that desire for simplicity feels.
                <br />
                <br />
                We live in an era obsessed with scaling. Scale your startup. Scale your audience. Scale your income. Scale your influence.
                <br />
                <br />
                Everything must grow.
                <br />
                <br />
                Your resume must improve. Your projects must get bigger. Your network must expand. Your skills must compound. Even hobbies are optimized. Even rest becomes productivity. Even peace is monetized.
                <br />
                <br />
                The modern world has trained us to measure ourselves in metrics. Followers, Users, Revenue, Commits, Views, Engagement. It's subtle, but powerful. Your worth becomes entangled with output.
                <br />
                <br />
                And if you're wired in like I am, if you love building, this system feels like fuel. You wake up excited to create. You measure progress in shipped features and refined architecture. You chase the next improvement like a high.
                <br />
                <br />
                But there's a cost to living in constant acceleration. There is no natural stopping point. There is always another feature, another refactor, another framework to learn and another competitor moving faster.
                <br />
                <br />
                The horizon keeps moving.
                <br />
                <br />
                Farming, at least in my imagination, feels like the opposite of this. You can't “scale” a tomato plant by pushing harder. You can't optimize sunlight. You can't deploy version 2.0 of spring.
                <br />
                <br />
                Nature does not respond to urgency. It responds to patience.
                <br />
                <br />
                The work is physical. Tangible. Honest. If you plant something and care for it, it grows. If you neglect it, it dies. The feedback loop is immediate and real.
                <br />
                <br />
                There's no abstract success. No vanity metrics. Just soil under your fingernails and a harvest at the end of the season. And maybe what draws me to that life isn't agriculture itself, it's the rhythm.
                <br />
                <br />
                A rhythm not dictated by algorithms or markets, but by time itself.
                <br />
                <br />
                Morning.
                Afternoon.
                Evening.
                Winter.
                Spring.
                <br />
                <br />
                There is something deeply human about that pace, and I wish to experience it myself. Modern ambition whispers: Become more. More skilled. More known. More impactful. More efficient.
                <br />
                <br />
                But simplicity asks a different question: <em>What is enough?</em>
                <br />
                <br />
                At what point does growth stop serving you and start consuming you? If you can build anything, <em>what should you build?</em> If you can scale endlessly, <em>should you?</em> These are uncomfortable questions for someone who loves creation.
                <br />
                <br />
                Because ambition feels noble. It feels productive. It feels like forward motion. Simplicity can feel like retreat. But maybe it doesn't have to be.
                <br />
                <br />
                Maybe it's discernment.
                <br />
                <br />
                I don't actually want to stop building. I don't want to abandon software engineering. I don't want to reject technology. It has shaped me. It excites me. It challenges me. It gives me a medium to express ideas and create impact. Just like me writing about my craving for being a farmer on a blog I made haha.
                <br />
                <br />
                The conflict isn't technology vs. farming. It's velocity vs. grounding. It's infinite growth vs. intentional limits. It's the difference between building because you love to build, and building because you're afraid to fall behind.
                <br />
                <br />
                The dream of the farm might just be my mind's way of asking:
                <br />
                <br />
                <em>“If you removed the noise, who would you be?”</em>
                <br />
                <br />
                If there were no metrics to impress, no timelines to chase, no audience to perform for, what would your days look like?
                <br />
                <br />
                Would you still build? <em>Or would you plant?</em>
                <br />
                <br />
                Maybe the farmer and the engineer are not opposites. Both cultivate. One cultivates land and the other cultivates ideas. Both require patience. Both require discipline and both depend on long-term thinking.
                <br />
                <br />
                Maybe the dream of becoming a farmer is less about escaping ambition, and more about redefining it.
                <br />
                <br />
                Maybe the real success isn't building the biggest thing.
                <br />
                <br />
                Maybe it's building something meaningful, and still being able to sit in silence when it's done. I don't know where I'll end up. Maybe I'll always live in cities, shipping software, building frameworks and refining systems.
                <br />
                <br />
                Or maybe one day I'll wake up somewhere quiet, watching the sunrise over a field that doesn't care about versioning numbers.
                <br />
                <br />
                And just in case a recruiter or employer happens to be reading this, let me be clear that I am still actively pursuing my career as a software engineer. I'm still building. I'm still learning and still chasing the dream that started when I was a teenager glued to a screen, trying to understand how the internet worked.
                <br />
                <br />
                This blog isn't a resignation letter. It's just a reflection.
                <br />
                <br />
                The desire to one day own a quiet country house doesn't cancel out my ambition. If anything, it sharpens it. I want to build meaningful things. I want to contribute to real systems. I want to work with talented people solving hard problems.
                <br />
                <br />
                Wanting peace in the long term doesn't mean I lack drive in the present. It just means I understand that life is bigger than any single season.
                <br />
                <br />
                So if you're reading this from a hiring perspective, don't worry. I'm not disappearing to a farm tomorrow (although I might, you never know). I'm still very much here, still eager, still hungry to grow, and very open to opportunities. The country house can wait. For now, I'm building.
                <br />
                <br />
                But If I'm being honest, deep down I think what I'm really chasing isn't a farm. It's peace, more than anything else in the world, I want peace.
                <br />
                <br />
                Not the kind you post about or the curated version with perfect lighting and filtered sunsets. But the quiet kind. The kind that doesn't need to be documented. The kind that exists whether anyone sees it or not.
                <br />
                <br />
                There are moments when I imagine a life where nothing interrupts that stillness. No drama. No emotional turbulence. No expectations to meet. No one pulling at my energy. Not even a relationship that slowly chips away at my quiet mornings.
                <br />
                <br />
                I imagine waking up alone in a small country house. No traffic in the distance. No buzzing phone on the nightstand. Just birds outside the window. Maybe a river moving steadily somewhere beyond the trees. Light spilling across my nice wooden floors. Silence that feels so full instead of empty.
                <br />
                <br />
                The kind of peace where my worth isn't tied to my output. Where my mornings aren't dictated by notifications. Where growth happens slowly, and I'm allowed to grow with it.
                <br />
                <br />
                If I can build a meaningful career and still protect that kind of peace, then maybe that's the real success. Peace, to me, is not the absence of ambition. It's ambition without anxiety.
                <br />
                <br />
                It's building because you love to build, not because you're afraid to fall behind. It's choosing your pace instead of inheriting one and knowing that your value doesn't fluctuate with metrics.
                <br />
                <br />
                If I ever own that quiet country house, it won't be because I ran away from something. It'll be because I built a life sturdy enough to slow down. And in a world obsessed with acceleration, sometimes the most radical thing you can do is slow down.
