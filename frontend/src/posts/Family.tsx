                Before I give my usual two cents in these blog posts, I want to offer
                some context. I have a friend who, for privacy reasons, I will call
                Amber. Amber has an incredibly troubled mother. Because of this, Amber
                never had the kind of childhood most kids on the block experienced.
                Instead of being carefree, she was forced into the role of a parent,
                taking care of her alcoholic and abusive mother and essentially raising
                herself while her mom was consumed by drugs and neglect.
                <br />
                <br />
                Amber's mother, who I will call Meadow, fits the textbook definition of a narcissist. She is entirely self-absorbed and frequently causes dramatic scenes driven by emotional instability. I have, unfortunately, met Meadow several times and have had long, direct conversations with her. I always found those interactions interesting, not because I admired her, but because I knew her history and wanted to understand how someone becomes the person she is. I wanted to believe that there was an explanation that made her behavior make sense, or at least feel less cruel.
                <br />
                <br />
                I would be lying if I said Meadow is a good person. I try to see the good in everyone and avoid judging people solely by their past or their flaws. Meadow, however, is one of the rare exceptions. I genuinely dislike that woman. She has directed extremely inappropriate racial slurs at me, made threats, and behaved like an immature teenager despite being in her late fifties. There was no accountability, no reflection, and no sense that she understood the damage she caused. Every conversation revolved back to her pain, her struggles, and her needs, as if everyone else existed solely to absorb the fallout. again a narcissist.
                <br />
                <br />
                With that context in mind, here is why I bring this up. Amber refuses to cut her mother off, even though Meadow consistently drags her down, belittles her, and makes her feel insignificant. Amber's reasoning is always the same. In her exact words: <em>“She's my mom at the end of the day. She's family.”</em> That response baffled me because I could not understand it.
                <br />
                <br />
                I have family members I have not spoken to in years because our relationships fell apart. I am not willing to waste time or energy on someone who clearly does not want to be in my life. To me personally, blood has never been a free pass to inflict harm. Respect and effort matter more than shared DNA. Because of that, it deeply confused me why Amber continued to tolerate behavior that was so obviously destructive.
                <br />
                <br />
                What made it even harder to understand was that Meadow herself has repeatedly threatened to cut Amber off as her daughter. Even then, Amber stayed, waiting patiently for her mother to come back. Watching this felt painful in a way I did not expect. It was like watching someone stand in the rain, convinced that if they stayed long enough, the storm would apologize.
                <br />
                <br />
                At first, I thought the answer was obvious. Trauma. Guilt. Conditioning. Years of being taught that love is something you earn by suffering quietly. But the more I thought about it, the more complicated it became. Amber was never taught what healthy love looks like. When neglect and volatility are all you know, chaos can feel familiar, even comforting. Walking away does not feel like freedom. It feels like abandonment, even when you are the one being abandoned over and over again.
                <br />
                <br />
                There is something deeply ingrained about the word “mother.” Society treats it as sacred, untouchable. We are taught from a young age that mothers are owed forgiveness, patience, and unconditional loyalty, regardless of how they behave. Cutting off a parent is framed as cruel, dramatic, or ungrateful, while enduring abuse is reframed as strength or maturity. Amber internalized that message long before she ever had the chance to question it.
                <br />
                <br />
                I started to realize that Amber was not staying because she believed Meadow would change. She was staying because leaving would mean accepting a truth that is almost unbearable. That her mother may never become the person she needed. That the love she waited for might never arrive. Letting go would not just mean losing her mom. It would mean mourning the idea of the mother she never had.
                <br />
                <br />
                My heavy frustration softened into sadness. It is easy to say “just cut them off” when you have never had to grieve someone who is still alive. It is easy to choose distance when you were never taught that your worth depends on endurance. Amber was not weak for staying. She was surviving in the only way she knew how.
                <br />
                <br />
                And yet, knowing all of this does not make the situation any less painful to witness. Understanding does not erase harm. Empathy does not make abuse acceptable. There is a difference between explaining behavior and excusing it. Meadow's actions are still damaging, and Amber's loyalty still costs her pieces of herself every time she chooses to stay.
                <br />
                <br />
                So I am left sitting with a harder question than the one I started with. <em>"At what point does compassion for someone else become cruelty toward yourself?"</em> Hear me now, <em>"How much suffering are we expected to tolerate in the name of family? And who taught us that love should hurt this much?"</em>
                <br />
                <br />
                Maybe the answer is not as obvious as I once thought. Or maybe it is, and accepting it is the hardest part.
                <br />
                <br />
                What troubled me most was not just what Meadow did to Amber, but what Amber slowly did to herself in response. Harm like this is rarely loud or immediate. It works quietly and patiently over the years. Every insult Amber absorbed without protest shaved down her sense of worth just a little more. Every time she stayed silent to keep the peace, she learned that her feelings were less important than avoiding conflict. None of it felt catastrophic at the moment and that is what made it so dangerous.
                <br />
                <br />
                Over time, Amber began to anticipate cruelty before it even arrived. She learned how to read Meadow's tone, her body language, the subtle shifts that signaled an incoming outburst. This constant vigilance became second nature. She lived in a state of readiness, always prepared to de-escalate, apologize, or sacrifice her own needs to prevent chaos. Existing like this takes an invisible toll. When your nervous system never rests, exhaustion becomes a baseline, not a warning sign.
                <br />
                <br />
                The cost of staying was not only emotional. It shaped how Amber saw herself and the world. She grew accustomed to shrinking. She learned how to make herself smaller, quieter, and easier to tolerate. Dreams were postponed. Boundaries were softened or erased entirely. There was always a reason to wait. After this crisis. After this apology. After things calm down. Life became something to endure rather than something to build.
                <br />
                <br />
                Amber did not just cope with her circumstances. She adapted to them. Strength, to her, began to mean endurance rather than self-respect. Love became synonymous with sacrifice. Loyalty meant staying even when staying hurt. These beliefs did not come from choice. They were learned through repetition, reinforced by years of being told, directly and indirectly, that her value came from how much she could tolerate.
                <br />
                <br />
                Staying also distorted Amber's understanding of responsibility. She felt accountable for her mother's emotions, her relapses, her loneliness, and her rage. When Meadow lashed out, Amber searched for what she had done wrong. When Meadow threatened to leave, Amber scrambled to fix it. This constant self-blame eroded her confidence. It taught her that other people's behavior was her burden to carry, even when it was never hers to begin with.
                <br />
                <br />
                Perhaps the most painful cost was the quiet grief Amber carried without naming it. By staying, she postponed the mourning she deserved. She held onto hope, not the hopeful kind that builds a future, but the kind that keeps you suspended in place. Hope that this time would be different. Hope that love would eventually be returned in the way it was given. Each disappointment added another layer of loss that never had space to be acknowledged.
                <br />
                <br />
                She did not just lose her childhood. She lost years of emotional safety. She lost the opportunity to learn what it feels like to be prioritized without conditions. She lost parts of herself in the process of keeping someone else afloat. And the cruelest part is that none of this looked dramatic from the outside. There were no clear breaking points, no singular moment that justified leaving. Just a slow erosion of self, carried out under the banner of family.
                <br />
                <br />
                Staying cost Amber more than people realize. It cost her peace. It cost her clarity. It cost her the ability to trust her own needs without guilt. And the longer she stayed, the harder it became to imagine a life not defined by reaction and repair. When survival becomes familiar, choosing yourself feels foreign, even wrong.
                <br />
                <br />
                That is the real danger of staying too long. You do not just remain in a harmful situation. You begin to shape yourself around it. And one day, you wake up unsure of where the damage ends and where you begin.
                <br />
                <br />
                The irony of it all is that Amber is grown now, pursuing a bachelor's degree in psychology with a focus on childhood therapy. She wants to help children who grew up in homes like hers. Kids who learned too early how to be quiet, careful, and emotionally self-sufficient. Kids who were never allowed to just be kids. In many ways, her academic path makes perfect sense. She understands pain intimately. She knows what neglect feels like from the inside. Her empathy is not theoretical, It is lived.
                <br />
                <br />
                And credit is where it's due, there is something beautiful about that. People who survive difficult childhoods often develop a heightened awareness of others' emotions. They notice the subtle signs of distress. They recognize patterns of behavior that most people overlook. Amber carries that sensitivity with her, and I have no doubt at all that it will make her an exceptional therapist. She does not just want to study trauma. She wants to prevent it from repeating itself in someone else's life.
                <br />
                <br />
                And yet, there is a quiet contradiction sitting beneath that ambition. Amber is learning, in a classroom, the very concepts she struggles to apply in her own life. Boundaries. Emotional safety. The long-term effects of neglect and narcissistic parenting. She can explain, with academic clarity, how growing up in unstable environments rewires a child's sense of self. She can identify the damage. She can name it. But naming something does not automatically free you from it.
                <br />
                <br />
                There's something haunting about watching someone dedicate their life to healing others while still bleeding themselves. It raises uncomfortable questions about how deeply trauma embeds itself. Knowledge alone does not undo conditioning. You can understand the psychology behind abuse and still feel powerless to walk away from it. You can know what healthy love looks like and still gravitate toward what feels familiar.
                <br />
                <br />
                Sometimes, the desire to help others is born from an unspoken hope that saving someone else will make your own story hurt less. That if you can protect a child from what you endured, it might somehow justify what you lost. Amber's compassion is real and admirable, but it also reflects how much responsibility she has carried for far too long. She learned early on to put others first. That instinct followed her into adulthood, into her education, and into her sense of purpose.
                <br />
                <br />
                This is where the irony cuts the deepest. Amber can advocate fiercely for children who deserve safety, stability, and care, yet she struggles to extend that same advocacy to herself. She believes those kids deserve protection. She believes they deserve better. But when it comes to her own life, the standard changes. Family complicates things. History complicates things. Love, or at least the idea of it, complicates everything.
                <br />
                <br />
                Which brings me to the question I keep circling back to. <em>Would you keep a family member in your life solely because they are family?</em> Not because they are kind. Not because they are supportive. Not because they make your life better. But simply because you share blood, history, or a title. That's it.
                <br />
                <br />
                We are taught that family is sacred, untouchable, and permanent. That cutting off a parent is a moral failure rather than an act of self-preservation. But no one talks enough about the cost of honoring family at the expense of yourself. No one talks about the quiet damage done when loyalty is demanded rather than earned.
                <br />
                <br />
                If a stranger treated you the way Meadow treats Amber, the answer would be obvious. You would walk away without hesitation. The only thing that complicates the decision is the word “family.” And yet, harm does not become acceptable simply because it comes from someone who helped create you.
                <br />
                <br />
                I'd argue the harder question is this. <em>At what point does keeping the peace become self-betrayal? At what point does understanding someone's trauma stop being compassionate and start becoming self-destructive?</em> And if Amber can look at a child and say, “You did not deserve this,” what would it take for her to believe the same thing about herself?
                <br />
                <br />
                I know I was asking a lot of questions in this blog but really sit down and think about them. Those are the questions that linger. Not just for Amber, but for anyone who has ever stayed too long, hoping that love would eventually outweigh the damage. 
                <br />
                <br />
                I'll leave you all with this, Blood does not give anyone the right to hurt you. A title does not excuse damage. And love that requires you to disappear is not love, it is survival dressed up as obligation. And if protecting yourself makes you the villain in someone else's story, that may be the price of choosing your own.
