                The story I am about to tell you has weighed heavily on my heart ever since
                it happened. It is something I have spent far more time thinking about
                than I would like to admit. Before I begin, I want to offer some context
                so the weight of this moment makes sense.
                <br />
                <br />
                Normally, when I write about people in my life, I like to change their names to
                protect their privacy. This time, I will not. This story is about my
                cousin, Bethany.
                <br />
                <br />
                Bethany and I have never had the strongest relationship. Growing up, I was much closer to her younger sister, my cousin Carolyn. Bethany was the older cousin, and like many older cousins, she picked on me. At times, she was outright mean. We rarely got along as kids, and for a long time, there was distance between us.
                <br />
                <br />
                That began to change when we got older. Around my late teenage years, Bethany softened toward me. We started talking more, spending time together, and genuinely connecting. I have several memories from those years that I still hold close, memories I am grateful I got to experience at all.
                <br />
                <br />
                For a brief period, it felt like we were finally building something real.
                We connected because we shared similar interests and found common ground in the way we viewed life. That bond, however, began to fade when Bethany found refuge in her faith sometime in late 2025. As her beliefs became more central to her identity, the things we once shared slowly disappeared. She no longer participated in activities we used to enjoy together because of her faith.
                <br />
                <br />
                I never made an issue out of this. I never expressed resentment or concern. In fact, I respected it. I genuinely applauded her for finding something that gave her peace and purpose. I believe everyone deserves something that brings them hope and a sense of serenity.
                <br />
                <br />
                I share all of this because it matters for what comes next. 
                <br />
                <br />
                From time to time, Bethany would stop by my house to visit our grandparents. When she did, we would catch up and make small talk about life. It felt normal, familiar, and safe.
                <br />
                <br />
                A few days before New Year's, Bethany came over while my ex-girlfriend was with me. The conversation was casual, but at one point, Bethany expressed concern about my life choices. I took it as constructive criticism. Opinions are just opinions, and I did not take it personally.
                <br />
                <br />
                Growing up, it was always our habit to dap each other up or give a hug when parting ways. Most of the time, it was just a dap up. As she was leaving, I held my hand out, waiting for that familiar dap up before she headed out the door.
                <br />
                <br />
                She did not move.
                <br />
                <br />
                Instead, she looked me directly in the eyes and said, “<em>Im not shaking your hand.</em>”
                <br />
                <br />
                At first, I thought she was joking. I laughed awkwardly and kept my hand out, waiting. She never reached back. When I asked why, she told me it was because of my poor life decisions. Moments later, she hugged my ex girlfriend goodbye.
                <br />
                <br />
                That moment stopped me cold.
                <br />
                <br />
                What hurt the most was not just the refusal. It was the contrast. My ex was no more perfect than I was. She had flaws. She had made mistakes. Just like me. Just like everyone. Yet she was worthy of a hug, while I was not worthy of a simple handshake.
                <br />
                <br />
                Only weeks earlier, I had been at Bethany's house for dinner with my uncle. That night, just Bethany and I sat at the table alone and had a long, genuine heart to heart conversation about her faith and her life choices. I listened. I asked questions. I respected her perspective. I left that night thinking we were finally rebuilding something meaningful.
                <br />
                <br />
                I was wrong.
                <br />
                <br />
                My biggest pet peeve, above anything else, is judgment. I cannot tolerate it. Watching someone judge another person, especially for things they themselves once did, strikes a nerve in me like nothing else. Seeing my own cousin do that to me felt deeply personal.
                <br />
                <br />
                That night, I argued with her. I was frustrated beyond reason. I criticized her faith, not because I hate religion, but because I did not understand how a belief system centered on love could justify rejecting someone so coldly. To me, it felt like hypocrisy, a contradiction between belief and behavior.
                <br />
                <br />
                After the anger faded, I was left alone with my thoughts. The adrenaline of the argument wore off, and in its place came doubt. I asked myself if I had crossed a line, if my words had been sharper than they needed to be. I wondered whether I spoke from truth or from pain, and whether my frustration had drowned out any chance for understanding.
                <br />
                <br />
                I replayed the conversation repeatedly, searching for a version of myself that responded with more patience and less defensiveness. I imagined different tones, different words, different outcomes. I considered how easily hurt can disguise itself as conviction, and how quickly emotion can turn a conversation into a confrontation. In those quiet moments, I felt the weight of my own imperfection.
                <br />
                <br />
                Still, no amount of reflection erased the image of my hand left hanging in the air waiting for her to dap me up. That moment remained fixed in my memory, untouched by revision or reinterpretation. Even as I questioned my reaction, the rejection itself did not lose its sting. It was not just about the argument, but about what it symbolized. A boundary drawn where I thought there was understanding.
                <br />
                <br />
                Coming to terms with that contradiction was difficult. I could acknowledge my flaws and still recognize the hurt I experienced. Both could exist at the same time. Growth, I learned, is not about absolving yourself or condemning the other person. It is about sitting with the discomfort of knowing you could have done better, while also honoring the pain that prompted the response in the first place.
                <br />
                <br />
                Later, I texted her. I wanted to understand. I wanted honesty. I wanted to know what really stopped her from shaking my hand. She never replied. I reached out more than once. Silence was the only response. Since that day, I have not seen or heard from Bethany. 
                <br />
                <br />
                That loss hurts more than I can put into words. All I ever wanted was a family bond. I wanted understanding, compassion, and mutual respect. If her religious principles prevent her from offering even basic humanity toward me and my life choices, then as painful as it is, I cannot keep reaching for someone who refuses to meet me halfway. Respectfully, I don't want anyone like that in my life.
                <br />
                <br />
                I have never believed I have the authority to judge another person, because I am painfully aware of my own flaws. I make mistakes. I fall short. I carry contradictions, regrets, and moments I wish I could undo. I am not clean or complete or morally superior, and I never will be. That awareness keeps me grounded and It reminds me that I stand beside others, not above them, just as they are not above me.
                <br />
                <br />
                When I look at my own life honestly, I see someone who is still learning, still unlearning, still growing. I am full of imperfections, just like everyone else. This is why I have a strong distaste for Judgement. If I were to judge someone else harshly, I would be pretending I am exempt from the same scrutiny. I am not. None of us are. Whatever we call it, sin, wrongdoing, failure, or simply being human, it lives in all of us.
                <br />
                <br />
                That is why judgment feels so misplaced, no matter who it comes from. If I do not possess the authority to condemn someone else, then I struggle to understand how anyone claims that authority over me. What makes one person's failures disqualifying, while others are forgiven or overlooked? At what point does belief turn into permission to withhold compassion?
                <br />
                <br />
                I am not asking for validation or approval. I am simply asking for humility. The kind that recognizes that no one arrives at life spotless or finished. If we are all flawed, then the only thing that truly makes sense is grace. Not the kind that excuses harm, but the kind that leaves room for people to exist, to grow, and to be met with dignity instead of judgment.
                <br />
                <br />
                I am telling this story because it highlights a contradiction I have seen far too often in religious practice. I want to be clear that I am neutral when it comes to religion and politics. I am not religious, but I am not anti religion. I am not an atheist, nor do I align myself with political movements, parties, or ideologies. I listen. I observe. And I stay out of the way.
                <br />
                <br />
                What I have noticed, though, is that some Christians speak loudly about love while practicing judgment toward those who do not believe or live the way they do.
                <br />
                <br />
                This story is not about attacking faith. It is about the quiet damage that happens when judgment replaces compassion. It is about how a single moment, something as small as refusing a handshake, can fracture a relationship that took years to rebuild. And it is about grief. The kind that comes not from losing someone to death, but from losing them while they are still alive.
                <br />
                <br />
                This story could have taken place under almost any banner. It could have been shaped by religion, politics, morality, or even personal philosophy. The belief system itself is not the problem. The problem begins when beliefs stop being a source of meaning and start becoming a measure of someone else's worth. When convictions harden into conditions, connection is often the first thing to be lost.
                <br />
                <br />
                I have seen this pattern repeat itself in many spaces, not just religious ones. People draw lines in the sand and decide who belongs on which side. Agreement becomes a requirement for respect. Difference becomes a justification for distance. In those moments, beliefs no longer serve as guides for how to live well, but as tools to exclude, rank, and judge.
                <br />
                <br />
                What gets overlooked in all of this is how fragile relationships really are. They are not sustained by shared opinions alone, but by empathy, patience, and a willingness to remain present even when views diverge. When we begin valuing ideology over humanity, we sacrifice something far more important than being right. We sacrifice understanding.
                <br />
                <br />
                At its core, this story is not about faith or disagreement. It is about what happens when people forget that beliefs are meant to inform how we treat others, not determine whether they deserve to be treated with kindness at all. No matter the ideology, love cannot survive where compassion is conditional.
                <br />
                <br />
                I still hope, one day, that Bethany remembers who I was before that moment. And maybe she will understand that love does not begin with judgment. It begins with seeing the humanity in the person standing in front of you.
                <br />
                <br />
                I do not need Bethany to agree with my life in order to love me. I never did. Love, at least to me, has never required alignment or approval. It only asks for recognition. To be seen as family first, as a human being before a belief system, flawed and still worthy of compassion. That is all I ever wanted from her, and it is all I continue to want.
                <br />
                <br />
                I have come to understand that reconciliation, if it ever happens, will not come from winning an argument or proving a point. It will not be built through scripture, explanations, or defenses. If it comes at all, it will arrive quietly, through something far more ordinary and far more difficult. A conversation where neither of us is trying to change the other. A moment where judgment is set aside long enough for honesty to breathe.
                <br />
                <br />
                I do not carry anger toward her anymore. What I carry is a cautious hope, the kind that does not demand anything in return. I hope that one day she remembers the years we laughed, talked, and shared space without conditions. I hope that she realizes love does not weaken when it reaches across differences, but deepens when it does.
                <br />
                <br />
                If that day ever comes, it will not need to be dramatic. It will not require apologies or explanations right away. It could start with something simple. A glance. A simple hello. A hand finally met instead of left hanging in the air. And if that moment never comes, I will still choose to move forward with softness rather than bitterness, believing that love, when it is real, does not keep score.
                <br />
                <br />
                Bethany, if you are reading this, I want you to know that I love you. I always have, and I always will. No matter what has happened between us, you are family, and that does not disappear with distance or disagreement. I truly hope life treats you kindly and that whatever path you are walking brings you peace and fulfillment.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you ever want to talk again, to catch up, or even to sit together the way we used to, that door is still open. There is no condition attached to it and no argument waiting on the other side. You have my number, and you always will. I am not asking for explanations or apologies, only honesty and humanity.
                <br />
                <br />
                And to anyone reading this who sees themselves in this story, I hope it serves as a reminder that you do not have to convince someone to live a certain kind of life in order to care about them. People are not projects, and love is not leverage. We all move through the world carrying our own flaws, our own histories, and our own struggles.
                <br />
                <br />
                Before judging another person, it is worth remembering how it feels to be judged yourself. Compassion does not require agreement, only humility. Sometimes the most meaningful thing we can offer one another is not correction, but understanding.
