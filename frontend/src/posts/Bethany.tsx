                The story I am about to tell has weighed heavily on my heart ever since
                it happened. It is something I have spent far more time thinking about
                than I would like to admit. Before I begin, I want to offer some context
                so the weight of this moment makes sense.

                Normally, when I write about people in my life, I change their names to
                protect their privacy. This time, I will not. This story is about my
                cousin, Bethany.
